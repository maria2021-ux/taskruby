# Answer to the question 
puts "\nProve why your solution is considered fast(er)?:"
puts "The solution is optimized by using an auxiliary stack for the `max` method, ensuring constant-time retrieval (O(1)) of the maximum value, even with a large number of elements."
puts "The `mean` method runs in constant-time (O(1)) by maintaining a running sum, avoiding the need to traverse the entire stack."
puts "Both the `push` and `pop` operations are performed in constant time (O(1)), ensuring fast performance regardless of stack size."
puts "These optimizations make the solution highly efficient, even for stacks with millions of elements, handling frequent `max` and `mean` calls with ease."
puts "Overall, the approach minimizes time complexity and provides a scalable solution for large-scale data processing."
